  text: "
    Hello there! My name is <b>Suchith</b> and I'm a <b>Developer</b> (I enjoy building stuff on the web and otherwise :)).
    I am currently pursuing my <b>undergraduate degree in computer science</b> at the University of New Brunswick, Canada. 
    <br><br>
    I'm a <b>Full-Stack programmer</b> who also specializes in <b>GUI and CLI</b> (Command-line interface) based application
    programming for Windows and Linux. I am passionate about computers and servers and intrigued about operating systems and
    their workings.
    <br><br>
    My specialties include setting up an environment for hosting a web app including coding <b>both frontend and backend</b>
    while simultaneously setting up a Linux server for hosting the app. 
    <br><br>
    What started out as an obsession to learn everything (I know it's not possible!!) ended up becoming one of my <b>biggest
    skill</b>. I am now an <b>intentional & passionate learner</b> who learns almost anything <em>quickly</em> and
    <em>effectively</em>.
    <br><br>
    My hobbies include (Not that anyone asked, but hey this is my website!) studying Astrophysics, Philosophy, Economics,
    Psychology, Theoretical Physics, and the rest of the sciences (fill in the blanks!).
